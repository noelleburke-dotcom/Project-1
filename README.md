hi!
here is my documentation!

sources
I followed a lot of Professor Moore's starter code from lab 4 then changed it to fit the launch page
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_circles.asp to create the circles and game pieces copied the code then edited to fit the game

ai useage
here are the conversations
https://chatgpt.com/share/68e97b23-ad04-8008-87f7-247062ed859e
https://chatgpt.com/share/68e83ac1-e050-8008-bb97-0be55cbadcf9
asking chatgpt for debugging like why the css wasn't working and it was there wasn't # or . in a few spots 
used to debug #hero h1 #play h3 
how to move the circles to the right spots 
position for the board relative and circles absolute
how to program multiple dots at once lines 21-23 were copied from chatgpt and edited to fit the code
gameboard js to set up event listener
gameboard.js for placing chips and switching turns
used for win check- had an outline just needed to switch to javascript was pretty hard to get the spots right needed help and explainations for parameters 
asked about making the turn switch display work
the win banner
chatgpt helped with dumb questions I had which was a lot... it would give some long winded answer that made no sense so I would ask to explain or break down the answer it gave so I would understand what was working. Also I wish it didn't just give corrected code unless asked for. I liked giving my code and asking why a specific thing wasn't working then it would just fix it not explain what was wrong. I feel like a lot of my project turned into chatgpt. I just wanted to ask questions and get explainations. 
what didn't work was it just giving me code. However I wouldn't just copy and paste it in I wanted to compare what was in its code against what was in mine. I didn't want to rely on ai for answers I just wanted to ask for explainations for what worked or didn't work and why. If I was unsure how to approach a function I would ask for the best way to go about it.
