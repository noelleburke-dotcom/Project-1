hi!
here is my documentation!

about the game
Last year for my final project in cs 65 I made connect 4. it was really difficult! I spent like 4 hours in the tutor lab! So with the knowledge I have now I wanted to remake it! Instead of user input I used an event listener for the placement of chips. Instead of the graphics I used css and bootstrap/ icons.

new thing learned
the animations i saw looked so cool! I wanted to try them... however it was really hard!! Plus with a deadline i had to switch to an easier animation which still looks cool! it was really confusing adjusting the code I found online to be added to my css and js. the url for the animation is listed below the ai reflection

challenges 
knowing what to do was the main problem. having made this game last year helped however adding new ways of programming it made it hard. switching from lots of if statements to functions was tricky. I have always had problems with scope of variables and this made it worse. I asked Professor Moore how should I approach the functions logically. and same to chat gpt when I couldn't ask Professor Moore. I had pseudo code for what I wanted the functions to do. I didn't know how to put it into javascript logic. To be honest all of this project felt like learning something new. 

sources
I followed a lot of Professor Moore's starter code from lab 4 then changed it to fit the launch page
Similarly with lab 3 for how to set up the game I followed the outline of her starter code and the final product of the lab. It was very helpful to have a direction to go or an idea to follow. Making a game all by myself was really hard!
Also asking Professor Moore LOTS of questions about practically everything to do with the project. I want to understand so I can do it on my own for the next assignment.

ai useage
here are the conversations

https://chatgpt.com/share/68e83ac1-e050-8008-bb97-0be55cbadcf9
asking chatgpt for debugging like why the css wasn't working and it was there wasn't # or . in a few spots 
used to debug #hero h1 #play h3 
how to move the circles to the right spots 
position for the board relative and circles absolute
how to program multiple dots at once lines 21-23 were copied from chatgpt and edited to fit the code
gameboard js to set up event listener
gameboard.js for placing chips and switching turns
used for win check- had an outline just needed to switch to javascript was pretty hard to get the spots right needed help and explainations for parameters 
asked about making the turn switch display work
the win banner
ai reflection
chatgpt helped with dumb questions I had which was a lot... it would give some long winded answer that made no sense so I would ask to explain or break down the answer it gave so I would understand what was working. Also I wish it didn't just give corrected code unless asked for. I liked giving my code and asking why a specific thing wasn't working then it would just fix it not explain what was wrong. I feel like a lot of my project turned into chatgpt. I just wanted to ask questions and get explainations. 
what didn't work was it just giving me code. However I wouldn't just copy and paste it in I wanted to compare what was in its code against what was in mine. I didn't want to rely on ai for answers I just wanted to ask for explainations for what worked or didn't work and why. If I was unsure how to approach a function I would ask for the best way to go about it. Once I am better with javascript I hope to never need to use ai!
